I reran the [untrimmed merged BAM](../../data/merged_bam) for SAMC703646 through [ViralConsensus v0.0.3](https://github.com/niemasd/ViralConsensus/releases/tag/0.0.3) to see what the base counts at each position look like before trimming. The `SAMC703646.untrimmed.unfiltered.*` files used the least strict ViralConsensus parameters (min base qual = 1, min depth = 1, and min base freq = 0) to see what would happen with the absolute most flexible settings, and the `SAMC703646.untrimmed.*` files used the default ViralConsensus v0.0.3 parameters (min base qual = 20, min depth = 10, and min base freq = 0.5).
